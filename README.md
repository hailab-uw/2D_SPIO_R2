## Usage:

### COMSOL Model
Uses COMSOL ≥ 6.0. The model already contains simulation results for the finite element quantifications, but may be modified and re-executed as needed.

### Python Code
Uses Python ≥ 3.8. To run code, execute:<br>
`conda env create -f environment.yml`<br>
`python QuantifyR2Tiff.py`<br>
